<h1> ReadMe for Triangular! </h1>
<p>
	My name is Jake Kaad.  I am a student at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> in Portland, Oregon. </br>
	This is my first javascript assessment for <strong> Epicodus </strong>
</p>

<p>
	Please download all files.  Open the html doc in your internet browser.  You can then enter a different length in each of the 3 forms. 
	</br>
	The logic will execute calculating whether or not the 3 sides make a triangle.  It will also determine what kind of triangle you have created.  In the results display, you will have a nice sentence declaring what kind of triangle you have, and draw an approximation of your triangle in using a SVG Polygon.

<h6>Challenges faced:</h6>  
	<ul>
		<li>I am still working my way through simple Javascript, but I am feeling much more comfortable.  </li>
		<li>Its been years since geometry, I had to remember things like the pythagoream therum and the laws of inequality</li>
		<li>Likewise, I hadn't used an x/y coordinate for awhile.  It took me awhile to get my triangle points down so it at least kinda looked like the triangle entered.
		<li>html continues to be a weakness of mine.  I am starting to get the hang of it, but even simple pages like these provide some challenge</li>
	</ul>
